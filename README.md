# React Fundamental concepts
1. Components: The entire application is composed of reusable React components, such as Navbar, Footer, Product, and Banner.
1. JSX: JSX syntax is used to write HTML-like code within JavaScript, making component structure more readable and expressive.
3. LocalStorage: LocalStorage is used alongside Context API to persist data across sessions allowing users to retain their cart and wishlist items even after page reloads.
4. useEffect Hook: The useEffect hook manages side effects such as data fetching from local storage synchronizing component states, and performing actions based on specific dependencies

# I use LocatStorage in this Project
LocalStorage works alongside Context API: the context initializes its state based on saved LocalStorage data when the app loads, and updates LocalStorage whenever items are added or removed from the cart and wishlist.
